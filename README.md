# About
The main goal of using E-conomic Updater is to speed up filling E-conomic and improving the quality of reported time entries. It contains list of user's activities grouped the source their were fetched from. So instead of looking for one's curent tasks in JIRA, Google Calendar one can just quickly select activities from previously mentioned lists. Description is automatically formated to the standard required by E-conomic coding standards. Duration, project and activity are also filled if proper hash tags were added to work log or calendar event summary. Day off confirmed in urlopek.pl are reported automatically  to E-conomic and absence calendar.
